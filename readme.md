# Beau's Vim config

This is my Vim config.

I use [Vundle][vundle] to manage [my plugins]. My `.vimrc` is
[`vim.vim`][.vimrc] and my `.gvimrc` is [`gvim.vim`][.gvimrc].

[my plugins]: http://github.com/beaumartinez/vim-config/blob/master/vundle.vim
[vundle]: http://github.com/gmarik/vundle
[.gvimrc]: http://github.com/beaumartinez/vim-config/blob/master/gvim.vim
[.vimrc]: http://github.com/beaumartinez/vim-config/blob/master/vim.vim

# Installation

**Note: I seem to remember the install script being horribly broken. I don't
think it works, but you can give it a shot anyway. I've got half a fix in
progress, but I'm shell-script–illiterate so it could be a while.**

It's one command. Run the [install script]:

[install script]: https://github.com/beaumartinez/vim-config/blob/master/install.sh

    curl -s https://raw.github.com/beaumartinez/vim-config/master/install.sh | bash

—And you're done!
